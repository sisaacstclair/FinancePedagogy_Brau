My default desire is not always to be gaming, but to be social. This can be accomplished through gaming when you play with friends.

I feel like because of Covid-19 I socially should not leave my apartment except for work, where normally to study, I would stay on campus in a carrol by myself in the Library to ensure I get stuff done.

Now I easily get distracted at my apartment with my bed, the kitchen, other noise and the other people around me. I also feel more of the need to work and find work so I can still pay for my apartment and food and even extra food, which takes up more time that I would normally use to study.
